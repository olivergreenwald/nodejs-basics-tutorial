What is Node.js?
  A runtime which allows us to run javaScript code on a server
Why do we use Node.js?
  Pros
    JavaScript code → don’t have to learn a new language if you already know JavaScript
    Non-Blocking → one thread, fast, handles multiple requests at a time
  Con
    Not as mature or new as Ruby, PHP, etc. 
    We can tell Node.js to listen to a certain port and handle all the requests in a certain way
Express Framework 
  builds on node → makes it easier and more fun to use Node
  Requires us to use a template engine → covers a lot of things we would have to do on our own otherwise
Node 
  A framework that is fairly straight forward, but we can use packages to add on to it and use it in a more advanced way
Mongo
  ./mongod → to run mongodb server
  ./mongo → to run a client
